- 👋 Hi, I’m @jasoncook32

- 👀 I’m interested in software development and web-based coding and development. I'm just starting out and am only a lowly freelancer.

- 🌱 I’m currently learning a lot actually. Right now I'm just trying to figure out how to make a difference in the world. 

- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything really. I'm not picky about what projects I work on. Like I said, I'm new and not really sure what I'm doing. Lol. 

- 📫 You can reach me either through GitHub or find my email. I check it pretty regularly. 

- ⚡ Fun fact about me: I am probably the only one in my family that can say they've actually been to see almost every state before they were 30.
